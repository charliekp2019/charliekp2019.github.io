        <h1>Travel to Santa Cruz</h1>
        <p>
            Santa Cruz is a smallish beach city just a couple hours south of San Fransisco. If you're looking for chill<br> surf and beach vibes, but hate SoCal, this is the place to be. Santa Cruz holds onto the NorCal vibes and<br> values we all know and love, but is still a surf destination that values beach culture.
